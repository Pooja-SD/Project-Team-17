## About Project:
Since all of us are new to this subject, we spent some sufficient time learning and discussing the basic concepts of Data Mining and Neuro linguistic Processing. After performing some initial research on the implementation of the project, the solution is boiled down to the certain techniques that we are going use to find the approximate if not accurate solution to the above problem. This is overall a basic implementation of the project. There is still a lot of scope for improvement of accuracy by using some Neural Networks concepts and Deep Learning embedding techniques.

Below are the techniques implemented as part of this project.
- CSR Matrix
- TF-IDF scoring
- Cosine Similarity

## Dataset:
Quora has released a dataset consisting of question pairs earlier this year. It includes 404351 question pairs with a label column indicating if they are duplicate or not. The score lsited for each question pair as 1 if both are simalar and 0 if both are different.

Note: The dataset file is too big to upload on GitHub, hence uploaded a sample test file containing 10 records of question pairs.
